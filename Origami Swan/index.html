        <p><i>Interesting facts about swans</i></p>
        <ul>
        
            <li>Trumpeter swans are the largest native waterfowl and the heaviest flying birds in North America. Their wingspans can reach up to 10 feet!</li>
            
            <li>Around the age of 2-4 years, swans choose a mate which they will generally remain with for the rest of their lives. In some cases, however, they will choose a new mate if their partner dies or if they are unsuccessful at breeding.</li>

            <li>Cygnus – the latin word for “swan” – is a brightly visible constellation also known as the northern cross. In Greek mythology, the constellation represents Orpheus, who was transformed into a swan after death – next to his lyre, in the constellation Lyra.</li>
